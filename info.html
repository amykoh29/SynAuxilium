<p style = "font-size: 25px; font-family: verdana;"> The sharing of contaminated needles can lead to bloodborne diseases such as: </p>
<ul>
  <li> HIV/AIDS </li>
  <p> HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It attacks your body through your immune system, killing off your T-cells and B-cells.
    These cells are crucial for fending off viruses, and a deficiency of them causes your immune system to weaken. Once the virus
  progresses in severity it becomes AIDS, causing the victim to get an increasing number of severe illnesses. </p>
  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/index.html"> More Information on HIV </a>
  <li> Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C </li>
  <p> Hepatitis is defined as the inflammation of the liver. The condition can disable some abilities to digest food,
    store energy, and remove poisons within the body. Hepatitis can be caused by different viruses, Hep. A (HAV), Hep. B
    (HBV), and Hep. C (HCV). The HBV and HCV viruses most commonly spread through infected blood and other bodily
    fluids, which could be left in contaminated needles. </p>
  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/index.htm"> More Information on Hep. C and Hep. B </a>
  <li> EBV </li>
  <p> EBV is short for the Epstein-Barr Virus. EBV is a very common disease and is a member of the herpes virus family.
  Although not very severe, EBV can cause fatigue, an inflamed throat, swollen liver, swollen lymph nodes, and and enlarged spleen. </p>

  <li> CMV </li>
  <p style = "background-color: #d5ceff;"> CMV is a permanent virus that, once infected, is retained by your body for life. The virus can be fatal
    for people with weakened or compromised immune systems, and women who contract the virus during pregnancy may
    pass symptoms on to their children.
